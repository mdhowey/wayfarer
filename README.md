- **Data Models:** Include at least two data models with associations. (4 total models: Profile(User), Post, City, Comment)
- **Data Validation:** Your application should validate incoming data before entering it into the database.
- **Error Handling:** Forms in your application should also validate data, handle incorrect inputs, and provide user feedback on the client-side.
- **Views:** Use **partials** to follow DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) development in your views. (base.html)
- **Home & About Pages:** Create a landing page (homepage) that clearly explains your app's value proposition and guides the user through the "get started" funnel. Create an about page that includes photos and brief bios of your team members.
- **User Experience:** Ensure a pleasing and logical user experience. Use a framework like Bootstrap to enhance and ease your CSS styling. **For this project, please choose a framework other than Bulma**. (Bootstrap)
- **Responsive Design*:** Make sure your app looks great on a phone or tablet.
